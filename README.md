# POSTGRESQL DATABASE SCRIPTING

This is me learning how to write scripts that can modify create tables and insert data into the tables automatically via code.  

## Why is this useful
In a company where employees use different machines, it sometimes becomes difficult to setup the codebase.   
I just learnt how to propagate PostgreSQL database via Docker commands. 

## Setup

- Have Docker running 
- Clone the repository.    
- cd into the project directory          
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install`    

### Usage
- Run `docker-compose up --build` to build and run the image
- Run `docker-compose down -v` to stop and remove volumes
